## **Executive Report: Customer Distribution & Revenue Concentration**

### **Project Overview**

This project analyzes customer transactions from an e-commerce retailer with the goal of enabling customer segmentation for marketing and business intelligence purposes. Using SQL, I cleaned and explored the dataset to prepare it for dashboarding and segmentation in Tableau.

### **Objectives:**

* Segment customers into champions, loyal, potential loyal, at risk and frequent buyers  
* Use RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis  
* Recommend tailored perks or offers per segment

### **Key Findings**

1. Geographic Concentration  
- The United Kingdom alone drives the majority of revenue, making the business highly dependent on a single market.  
- Although there are many customers across other European countries, each contributes less than 1% of global sales individually. This indicates broad but shallow penetration outside the UK.  
2. Customer Concentration (Pareto Analysis)  
- Only 16% of customers generate 80% of total revenue.  
- A large proportion of customers contribute minimally (“long tail”), which suggests that revenue is heavily dependent on a small elite group.  
- Many of these top customers fall under the “Frequent buyers” RFM segment, indicating they may not yet be well defined or managed within the current segmentation strategy.  
- Without clear classification, these high-value customers may not be receiving tailored engagement or retention strategies. By refining the segmentation model, we can better identify and nurture these hidden top performers — turning “Frequent buyers” into clearly defined Champions or Loyal Customers.  
3. Risk Profile  
- Market risk: Over-dependence on the UK could expose the business to economic or regulatory shocks in that region.  
- Customer risk: Revenue reliance on a narrow group of customers increases vulnerability to attrition or competition.  
4. Opportunities  
- Market expansion: Non-UK countries already show customer presence but low revenue. With targeted offers, these markets could be growth engines.  
- Customer development: Mid-tier customers could be nurtured into high-value accounts through loyalty programs, upsell, or cross-sell initiatives.  
- Diversification: Reducing reliance on top 16% customers by expanding engagement in the long tail could stabilize revenue.

### **Strategic Recommendations**

* Protect & Grow Core Customers (Top 16%)  
- Dedicated account management, exclusive benefits, and retention-focused strategies.  
* Activate Underperforming Regions  
- Tailored campaigns in non-UK European markets to increase share of revenue contribution.  
* Expand Mid-Tier Customer Value  
- Identify frequent buyers with moderate spend and target them with bundled products or loyalty incentives to move them into higher-value brackets.  
* Revenue Diversification Strategy  
- Broaden the base by encouraging more low-value customers to contribute consistently, reducing reliance on a few key accounts.
